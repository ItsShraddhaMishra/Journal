## Revert back N number of commits

git checkout master # go to master branch
git pull # sync the commits that are on Bitbucket
git log --oneline # to see which commit we want to go back to
git reset --soft 5030f12 # 5030f12 is the commit we want to go back to, soft will keep the modification in stage
git stash # save the modification in stage for future use, now the stage should be clean
git checkout -b document # create and checkout a branch called "document"
git stash apply stash@{0} # apply the modifications that are committed after 5030f12
git add README.md # add the file we want to commit, in this case, it's README.md
git commit -m "Mishra's work with the message: Documentation of setting up VM, SSH key for VM, docker image, ENV management, airflow" # make a new commit
git push --set-upstream origin document # push the commits to Bitbucket
# You can add more commits at document branch, when you are ready, open a pull request in Bitbucket (from "document" to "master").

## Check listening ports with netstat (https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/checking-listening-ports-with-netstat/)

If you’re troubleshooting a service that you know is running normally, the next step is to ensure it’s listening on the correct network port.

The netstat command shows the services listening to ports on a Linux server and the details of any connections currently made to them. The connection details to consider during basic network daemon troubleshooting are the addresses that the daemon is listening on (including the port number), the daemon’s process identifier (PID), and the program name.

You need to run netstat on the server that is running the service. Netstat is not affected by your firewall configuration.

sudo netstat -plnt ##Check ports
sudo netstat -plnt | grep ':80' #Filter the list

## When docker daemon gives Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8000: bind: address already in use
docker logs aiello_ie-init
netstat -tulpn | grep :8000
ps ax | grep 8000
netstat -lp| grep :8000
sudo su -
netstat -lp| grep :8000 ##output: cp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      909513/python
